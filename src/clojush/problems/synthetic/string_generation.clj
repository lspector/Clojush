#_"
The string generation problem asks for a mapping from an index to a character in a string.
The string is 15 chracters long, containing only uppercase letters.
You can make the string dynamic by setting 'dynamic-string?' to true.
In this setting, the target string is dynamic, changing every 50 generations.
We calculate the difference in the number of zero error cases between the last generation of using a target string and the first generation of its use.
We keep a record of the differences in the 'improvement-vector' atom, which is displayed in every generation's problem-specific-report.
